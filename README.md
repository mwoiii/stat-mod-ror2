Untitled Stat Mod
=================

### About
This is an untitled WIP mod for Risk of Rain 2 that will present awards at the end of a run in a fashion similar to Mario Party Bonus Stars, but to a more detailed extent. The mod will collect a variety of data on the behaviour of the players, and determine certain characterstics that where exibhited during the run. The most prominent characteristics will then be displayed for vviewing at the end of a run, to allow for fun discussion among all players.

### Installation
As this mod is unfinished, no download exists on Thunderstore at this time. If for some reason you want to install the mod in its current state, you can clone the repo and build the solution.
