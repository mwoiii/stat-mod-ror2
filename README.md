Untitled Stat Mod
=================

### About
This is an untitled WIP mod for Risk of Rain 2 that collects a variety of information about the players throughout the run and will allow the stats to be viewable upon reaching the results screen, with graphs to show the progression at key points in the run.

### Installation
As this mod is unfinished, no download exists on Thunderstore at this time. If for some reason you want to install the mod in its current state, you can clone the repo and build solution.
